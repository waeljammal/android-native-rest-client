Native android client for the java-spring-rest service.

Make sure you launch the java-spring-rest service by following the instructions in the java-spring-rest read me.

Once launched open this project with Android Studio and launch it on your emulator, the url is coded to access local host so if
you want to run this on your device then make sure you change the ip address in the Main.java file.
